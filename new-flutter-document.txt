OVERVIEW

Purpose: Design a polished, modern, dark-theme dating mobile app for the LGBTQ+ community. The UI should feel premium, intimate, inclusive and approachable. The visual references show a predominantly dark interface with a strong purple-magenta accent, rounded cards, story-like avatar rings, subtle glassy containers and tactile micro-interactions. The document below captures every UI, UX, animation, component, style token, Flutter implementation guidance, packages, accessibility and production considerations required to implement a faithful recreation.

Target platforms: Mobile (Flutter: iOS & Android). Primary view: phone portrait 360–430pt width.

Tone & UX Principles

* Inclusive language & UI. Pronouns and gender options must be flexible and discoverable.
* Fast, tactile, movement-first experience: swipes, haptics, smooth transitions.
* Dark-first design with light-mode fallback.
* Clean hierarchy: avatars and photos are the focal point.
* Minimize friction for core flows: signup → discovery → match → chat.

DESIGN TOKENS

Colors (Primary dark theme):

* Background (page): #0B0B0D (very dark gray/near-black)
* Elevated Surface / Cards: #121214 (slightly lighter than background)
* Accent Purple (primary): #8A2BE2 (use as main actionable color)
* Accent Gradient Start: #7B2BE2 (hex: #7B2BE2)
* Accent Gradient End: #D33CFF (hex: #D33CFF)
* Secondary Accent (pink): #FF3CA6

Color usage rules:

* Use Accent Gradient for CTA backgrounds and story rings.
* Use single Accent Purple for solid buttons; gradient for primary hero components.
* Maintain AA+ contrast for body text: primary text on background must be > 4.5:1.

Typography

* Primary font family (display + body): Inter (or Google: 'SF Pro' on iOS; fallback: 'Roboto').
* Headline font weight and sizes (mobile pts):

  * H1 / Large title: 28–32 px (700) — e.g., Profile name
  * H2 / Card title: 20–24 px (600)
  * H3 / Small title: 16–18 px (600)
  * Body: 14 px (400)
  * Small / Caption: 12 px (400)
* Line heights: 1.2 for titles; 1.4 for body.
* Letter spacing: normal to -0.2 for display, 0 for body.
* Use italics sparingly for metadata (e.g., job titles).

Border radius & spacing

* Global radius tokens:

  * Radius XS: 6px
  * Radius SM: 12px (cards)
  * Radius MD: 16px (dialogs)
  * Radius Round: 999px (avatars, pill buttons)
* Elevation / shadows (dark theme subtle):

  * Surface: none or light inner shadow: 0 6px 18px rgba(0,0,0,0.6)
  * Floating card: 0 10px 30px rgba(0,0,0,0.7) + small top highlight rgba(255,255,255,0.02)

Grid & layout

* Base horizontal padding: 16 px
* Content vertical rhythm: 12 / 16 / 24 spacing increments
* Column grid: single column mobile; profile gallery grid: 2 columns with 8px gaps.

Iconography

* Icon set: use Material Icons or custom line icons with 18–24 px core sizes.
* Action icons (like, message, close): 24 px tappable area minimum 44x44 px.
* Round tab icons in bottom nav with active accent.

COMPONENTS (REUSABLE)

1. Avatar + Story Ring

* Circular avatar with double ring: thin outer gradient (accent gradient) + inner subtle glow.
* Online indicator: small 10x10 green dot at avatar bottom-right with 2px white ring.
* Tapping opens Profile preview sheet.

2. Profile Card (discover swipe card)

* Full-bleed photo, bottom gradient overlay (black 0 -> rgba(0,0,0,0.55)).
* Name + age + distance on bottom-left; badges on top-left (e.g., verified, pronouns).
* Action row: like, message, super-like icons centered within small pill overlay.
* Border radius: 24 px; shadow: soft elevated.
* Hero animation: Hero widget for image to profile page.

3. Message List Item (Chat list)

* Left: circular avatar with ring; center: name (bold) + last message (muted); right: time + unread badge (red circle with number).
* Typing indicator: "Typing..." with animated 3-dot micro-interaction where dots pulse.

4. Bottom Navigation

* 5 items (Home/Discover, Browse/Explore, Favorites, Chat, Profile).
* Floating, rounded background container (glass) with active item purple and a small elevation.
* Use icons + no labels (or labels optional on first use).

5. Profile Page

* Top: close/back, edit icon.
* Large circular avatar centered with gradient ring, name and short tagline below.
* Stats cards: Activities / Likes / Life Moments (rounded small cards with shadow).
* Action buttons: Subscribe (gradient pill), Authentication (icon row), Terms, Wallet — each as list tile with icon and chevron.

6. Small components

* Pills (filter chips), captions, small badges, verification badge, pronoun badge.
* Modal bottom sheet: rounded top radius 16 px, drag indicator 40x4 px.
* Skeleton loaders: animated shimmer across cards.

7. Swipe & Match UI

* Swipe left/right with elastic physics.
* When like & match, play match modal: dual avatars converge to center, confetti + heart burst, sound, haptic.
* Provide Match animation Lottie.

PAGES / SCREENS (flow)

Core flows and screens:

1. Onboarding (3–4 slides): inclusive language, gender & pronoun selection, photo permission.
2. Authentication: Phone + OTP, Email, Social (optional Apple / Google / Facebook). Option for anonymous browsing.
3. Profile creation/edit: Photos, pronouns, gender identity (multiple), sexual orientation (optional), bio, job, location, interests, verification flow.
4. Home / Discover: main card stack + top rounded avatars (stories), filters floating.
5. Explore / Grid: grid browsing of profiles.
6. Matches: list of mutual likes.
7. Chat: messaging with message input, attachments (image, voice), read receipts, typing indicators.
8. Profile detail: full profile, gallery, shared interests, report/block buttons.
9. Notifications center: likes, super-likes, matches, system.
10. Settings / Profile area: subscription management, wallet, terms, authentication, privacy & safety.
11. Payments / Subscription screens: purchase flow, restore, promo code.
12. Moderation / Report flow: report reasons, submit evidence, block.

ANIMATIONS & MICRO-INTERACTIONS

Animation Guidelines (timing & curves):

* Micro interactions: 120–220 ms, ease-out cubic (Cubic(0.0, 0.0, 0.2, 1)).
* Medium transitions (card -> profile): 260–360 ms, easeInOut.
* Large modals & match: 500–900 ms with overshoot for personality (Curves.elasticOut or custom cubic-bezier(0.2,1.3,0.6,1)).
* Ghost fade: 180 ms, linear.

Key animations:

* Story ring: subtle rotation (slow) or pulsing gradient; hover scale 1.06.
* Avatar press: scale to 0.96, return bounce.
* Like button: heart pop + color fill + particle burst (Lottie).
* Swipe card: rotation + translation tracking finger, snap with spring physics; opacity of underlying cards gradually changes.
* Typing dots: three-dot bounce loop (200ms each, staggered).
* Bottom nav transition: icon scale + tiny upward movement when selected.

Accessibility-related animations:

* Respect Reduce Motion flag: provide reduced animations option toggled in settings.

---

INTERACTIONS & GESTURES

* Swipe left / right for like/dislike; double-tap to super-like.
* Long-press avatar to preview quick details (bottom sheet) without navigating.
* Pull to refresh on feeds.
* Drag to reorder photos in profile edit.
* Swipe on chat item to reveal quick actions (mute, archive, delete).

Haptics

* Light impact on like/dislike.
* Heavy impact on match.

---

FLUTTER IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES

State management

* Recommended: Riverpod (flutter_riverpod) for predictable, testable state across app.
* Alternative: Bloc (flutter_bloc) if team prefers event-driven.

Routing

* go_router for declarative routing with nested routes and deep links.

Suggested packages

* flutter_riverpod — state management
* go_router — navigation
* cached_network_image — image caching
* photo_view — zoomable photos
* image_picker — pick camera/gallery
* image_cropper — crop/rotate avatar
* flutter_secure_storage — secure token storage
* http / dio — network client (dio recommended for interceptors)
* lottie — match/confetti animation
* animations — Material motion components & shared axis
* flutter_hooks (optional) — cleaner lifecycle code
* url_launcher — open external links
* in_app_purchase / purchases_flutter — subscriptions
* firebase_messaging (optional) — push notifications
* webview_flutter — legal/terms pages (if needed)
* permission_handler — camera, microphone, location
* flutter_local_notifications — local notifications
* flutter_dotenv — environment variables

Assets & image optimization

* Use 2–3 sizes for avatars (hd, md, thumbnail). WebP for size efficiency.
* Use progressive loading: small blurred placeholder -> high-res image.
* Namespacing: assets/images/avatars/, icons/svg/, lottie/match.json

* Integration tests for auth flows.

Performance

* Use image caching and placeholders.
* Limit number of widgets rebuilt during swipe by keeping gesture listeners and pointer events efficient.
* Use const constructors where possible.

BACKEND & API CONSIDERATIONS

(High-level only) If you plan Laravel backend (recommended for control):

* Auth endpoints: /auth/login, /auth/register, /auth/otp
* Profile: GET/PUT /profiles/{id}, POST /profiles/{id}/photos
* Discovery: GET /discover?lat=&lng=&filters=&cursor=
* Like/Match: POST /interactions/like, GET /matches
* Chat: WebSocket channel /ws/messages (or Pusher), REST fallback for history
* Moderation: POST /report, admin endpoints for review
* Payments: /payments/create, webhook endpoints for provider
* Media: S3-compatible storage with signed upload URLs

Security

* JWT or OAuth2 tokens, refresh tokens secure storage.
* Rate limiting for interactions (e.g., likes per minute) to mitigate abuse.
* Image content moderation: automatic moderation via 3rd party (e.g., AWS Rekognition / Azure Content Moderator) + manual review queue.
* Strict input validation and sanitization.

Privacy & Legal

* Opt-in for location sharing; allow manual location input.
* Clear privacy policy & terms during onboarding.
* Export / delete account features to comply with GDPR-style requirements.

---

MONETIZATION & SUBSCRIPTIONS

Example tiers:

* Free: basic browsing & messaging, limited rewinds, visible in grid.
* Premium (monthly/annual): unlimited likes, see who liked you, boost, advanced filters, read receipts, ad-free.
* Consumables: Super-likes, Profile boosts, one-time purchase for verification.

Payment integration

* Android & iOS in-app purchases for mobile store subscriptions + server-side verification.
* For regions where app store payments are restricted, provide web checkout via Stripe (server side) and link purchases to user account.

---

ACCESSIBILITY

* Minimum tappable size: 44x44 px.
* High contrast mode toggle.
* Screen reader labels for important controls (e.g., avatar: "Ava Williams, 23, online").
* Provide text alternatives for images where possible.
* Respect system font scaling.
* Provide reduce-motion toggle.

---

MODERATION, SAFETY & COMMUNITY

* Safety center accessible in settings.
* Quick report flow on profile and chat.
* Automatic detection for abusive content (text & image).
* Temporary mute / block options plus admin escalation for severe cases.
* Verified badge flow to deter catfishing (ID verification optional).

---

DELIVERABLES / ASSETS TO PROVIDE TO DEV

Design deliverables (designer -> dev):

* Figma file with pages for each screen, components as variants, and interactive prototype.
* Export tokens (colors, typography, spacings) as a JSON or style dictionary.
* SVG icon set and optimized PNG/WebP images for avatars & placeholders.
* Lottie files for match/confetti and micro-animations.
* A component inventory mapping Figma components to Flutter widgets.

Developer deliverables:

* ThemeData + token file.
* Reusable widget library (avatar ring, card, bottom nav, chat bubble).
* Demo app with discover flow + swipe + chat + profile edit.

---

SAMPLE UX DECISIONS & EDGE CASES (practical rules)

* Ghosting feedback: show "Last active" only when within 7 days; otherwise show approximate time or hide.
* Photo rejection: enforce aspect ratio and size with immediate feedback.
* Empty states: friendly microcopy and CTA to complete profile.
* Privacy: give control to hide distance and last seen.

---

IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST (priority phases)

Phase 1 (MVP):

* Auth (phone/email), profile creation, photo upload, explore stack, swipe gestures, match detection, basic chat (persisted REST), settings.

Phase 2:

* Subscriptions, push notifications, advanced filters, media moderation, in-app purchases, refine animations, match Lottie.

Phase 3:

* Video messaging, live events, stories, third-party integrations (identity verification), analytics & A/B testing.

---

DEV NOTES / CODE STUBS (naming & API ideas)

Widget names

* AvatarRing
* DiscoveryCard
* ChatListTile
* ProfileStatsCard
* FloatingBottomNav

Provider examples

* discoverProvider (Stream/StateNotifier) for lazy-loading stacks
* swipeControllerProvider for gesture handling

Animation tokens (examples)

* microDuration = Duration(milliseconds: 150)
* smallDuration = Duration(milliseconds: 260)
* mediumDuration = Duration(milliseconds: 400)
* largeDuration = Duration(milliseconds: 700)
* curveAccent = Curves.easeOutBack

FINAL NOTES & DESIGN CRITIQUE

What's working in the reference UI:

* Strong visual focus on people — excellent for dating.
* Dark theme + purple accent is luxurious and gender-neutral.
* Rounded cards and glassy containers feel modern and friendly.

Potential weaknesses to watch for (be brutal):

* Low-contrast secondary text in dark mode may fail accessibility — make sure body and critical copy meet contrast thresholds.
* Too many heavy animations will hurt performance on older devices; provide reduced-motion.
* Overreliance on avatar rings for status might clutter the header — keep a clear hierarchy.

If you want, I can:

* Export this spec into a downloadable .txt file (ready) and also produce a Figma component mapping or Flutter starter repo scaffold.
