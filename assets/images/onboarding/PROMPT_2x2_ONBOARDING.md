## Prompt (copy below)

**One square image, 2×2 grid of four equal panels, no borders between panels. Each panel is a single, clean mobile-app onboarding illustration on plain white or very light off-white background. Flat design, minimal, friendly. Diverse people (different skin tones, genders, styles). Muted, warm palette: soft red, terracotta, mustard, sage green, dusty blue, soft violet (subtle pride-inspired but not bright). No circles, no blobs, no logos behind the figures. Each scene is self-contained in its quadrant.**

**Top-left:** Person smiling, arms open or hand over heart, welcoming gesture. Sense of a safe, inclusive space. Warm and inviting.

**Top-right:** Person holding a phone or tablet, swiping or browsing profiles. Small heart or match icons nearby. Discovery and connection.

**Bottom-left:** Two people in conversation: chat bubbles, or one person typing on phone with a smile. Connection and messaging.

**Bottom-right:** Person relaxed, being themselves (e.g. casual pose, hobby, or confident gesture). Authenticity and community.

**Style:** Flat illustration, subtle shadows, no heavy outlines. Professional app onboarding quality. 1024×1024 or 2048×2048 output, then crop each quadrant to 512×512 (or 1024×1024) and save as slide_1.png, slide_2.png, slide_3.png, slide_4.png.
